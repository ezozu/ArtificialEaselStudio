# ArtificialEaselStudio

## Description

A generative NFT art platform leveraging PyTorch-based neural style transfer and diffusion models to create unique, AI-crafted artwork, with integrated support for ERC-721 tokenization and on-chain provenance tracking.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the ArtificialEaselStudio software project:
- "Utilizes generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create realistic brushstroke simulations",
- "Employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image segmentation and object detection",
- "Integrates with popular computeraided design (CAD) software through APIbased import/export",
- "Supports realtime collaborative editing with conflict resolution and version control",
- "Features a physicsbased engine for simulating canvas texture and paint viscosity",
- "Includes a customizable color palette management system with color theory rules",
- "Provides an extensible plugin architecture for integrating thirdparty AI models and algorithms"
- Let me know if you'd like me to generate more!
